We are happy to announce the opening of the new official website

This website is completely **static**, so that it consumes less cpu hours and does not need a database. This also makes the website very **secure**, no injections and password hack works on this website.

The source code of the website can be found on our [Github Repository](https://github.com/yo-ren/web)

Thanks to the opensource framework [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) that made the creation of the website a nice experience.

To acquire a copy of this website please issue the following command in your console:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yo-ren/web.git
```

Feel free to submit any bugs and issues with our official at the following address:
