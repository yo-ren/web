We are happy to announce the opening of the new official website!

This website is completely static, thus consumes fewer CPU hours and reducing total cost of ownership. This also makes the website very secure as no injections or script vulnerability exploits will work on this website.

The source code of the website can be found on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yo-ren/web)

Special thanks to the open-source projects [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) that made the creation of the website a pleasant experience.

We appreciate reports of any bugs or issues on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/yo-ren/web/issues)!
